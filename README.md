# Data Visualization with Python

This repository contains several Python scripts that demonstrate data visualization techniques using libraries such as Matplotlib and Pygal. The visualizations cover topics such as scatter plots, random walks, and simulations of dice rolls.

## Project Contents:

### 1. `scatter_squares.py`
This script generates a scatter plot showing squares of numbers using Matplotlib. It also utilizes colormaps for better visual representation.

### 2. `rw_visual.py`
Simulates and visualizes a random walk with 50,000 points using Matplotlib. The starting point is marked in green and the ending point in red.

### 3. `random_walk.py`
Contains the `RandomWalk` class which generates random walk data that is used by `rw_visual.py` for plotting.

### 4. `mpl_squares.py`
A simple line plot showing squares of values. It demonstrates how to set titles, labels, and tick sizes using Matplotlib.

### 5. `different_dice.py`
Simulates rolling a D6 and a D10 die 50,000 times and visualizes the results using Pygal's bar chart.

### 6. `die_visual.py`
Simulates rolling a D6 die 1,000 times and visualizes the frequency of each result in a bar chart using Pygal.

### 7. `die.py`
Defines the `Die` class used for rolling dice in the scripts.

### 8. `dice_visual.py`
Simulates rolling two D6 dice 1,000 times and visualizes the result frequencies using Pygal.
